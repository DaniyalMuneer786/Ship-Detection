# Ship Detection Using YOLOv8 🚢

This project is a web-based application that detects ships in images using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. It provides a simple interface where users can upload images, and the system returns the same image with bounding boxes drawn around detected ships.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Allow users to upload an image.
- Detect ships using YOLOv8.
- Display the processed image with bounding boxes.
- Provide a simple and user-friendly web interface.
